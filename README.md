# Sample Code
A repo for hosting sample Android Studio / FIRST Robotics code.

This does not include example Java code, only how to use FTC's libraries.

This is only meant to use as a reference, only edit if libraries changes and code becomes depricated.

For extremely dense, thorough documentation vist https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/index.html. Here be dragons...
